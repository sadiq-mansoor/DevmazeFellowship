## ASSIGNMENT 

#### Question 1: what is the difference between Procedural programming And OOP?

Answer 1: Procedural programming uses functions to manipulate data, while object-oriented programming uses classes and objects. OOP is more suited for larger, more complex projects and provides additional concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.


#### Question 2: what you think that we can learn in OOP?

Answer 2: object-Oriented Programming (OOP) teaches us to create modular, maintainable, and flexible software systems. Key concepts of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and modularity. Encapsulation helps to keep implementation details hidden, while inheritance and polymorphism allow for code reuse and flexibility. Abstraction helps to simplify the design process, and modularity improves the overall quality of the code. By using these concepts, developers can create more efficient and effective software systems.
